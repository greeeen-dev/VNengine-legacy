# VNengine-legacy
A poorly programmed visual novel engine for PCs. I mean it when I said poorly programmed HAHA

I've decided to do a complete rewrite ever since, so this one's not being used now. Do whatever you want with it, 
but remember to credit me for it since in the end it's still my code.

enjoy :P
