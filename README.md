# HSD: Journey (and its scrapped code)
A poorly programmed visual novel engine for PCs. I mean it when I said poorly programmed HAHA

I've decided to do a complete rewrite ever since, so this one's not being used now. Do whatever you want with 
this, but remember to credit me for it since in the end it's still my code.

The name's been scrapped as well, but the project is still ongoing. The repository for that is private for now, 
as the code is still very WIP.

The engine is very poorly optimized, so if you have a potato, good luck running it.

enjoy :P
